            As discussed in the previous blog post, I usually complete crosswords on the NYT app rather than on paper. However, you may have noticed that most articles giving strategy advice are geered toward solving on paper. For example, does it still make sense to start with fill-in-the-blank answers when you would have to click through every single one to find them? For me, the answer is no. Here is my step by step process for solving.

            
          <p>
            I begin with the across clues in order, filling in what I know. If there is something you are unsure of, but have an idea about, there is usually another color you can write the word in to indicate that. Personally, I usually just fill it in anyway and delete later if need be. Then, I repeat with the down clues, changing any of the across ones if necessary. After this point is when I usually begin solving by section, looking for areas where we have more letters filled in already to use as hints. Depending on the day of the week, I will use the check feature if I am stuck. After you have filled in everything you think you can, I would recommend stepping away from the puzzle for a few minutes. I find that after this break I am usually able to find something new that I couldn&#39;t see before. Repeat until you have solved the puzzle!
