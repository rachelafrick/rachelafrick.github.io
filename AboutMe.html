  <section>Doing crossword puzzles involves solving clues for the correct word or phrase. Solving crossword puzzles is a fun way to pass time while engaging your mind. I love solving them because I enjoy watching my times improve over time, as well
    as making more progress on puzzles later in the week which are usually more difficult. I usually do the New York Times puzzles, either in the newspaper physically or on their crossword app. </section>
